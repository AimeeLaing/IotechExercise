# IotechExercise 01

This Exercise was complete in C and tested on both Ubuntu and MacOS Montery. This solution utilises the Library Json-C which will need to be installed to compile. This library can be found at https://github.com/json-c/json-c

The project was compiled using gcc and to compile the command is: gcc -o ex1 Ex1.c -ljson-c

When executing the project the program takes in one input (the initial JSON file) e.g. ./ex1 devices.json and will output a reformatted json file called output.json an example that was created while testing the finished program is provided
